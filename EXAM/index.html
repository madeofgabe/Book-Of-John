            <h5> The Word Became Flesh </h5><br>
            <p>
                1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <br>
                2 He was with God in the beginning. <br>
                3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <br>
                4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. <br>
                5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. <br>
                6 There was a man sent from God whose name was John. <br>
                7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. <br>
                8 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <br>
                9 The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. <br>
                10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <br>
                11 He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <br>
                12 Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become
                children
                of God— <br>
                13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.
                <br>
                14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one
                and
                only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <br>
                15 (John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘He
                who
                comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ ”) <br>
                16 Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. <br>
                17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <br>
                18 No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship
                with the Father, has made him known. <br>
                John the Baptist Denies Being the Messiah <br>
                19 Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask
                him
                who he was. <br>
                20 He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.”
                21 They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He
                answered, “No.” <br>
                22 Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say
                about yourself?” <br>
                23 John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness,
                ‘Make
                straight the way for the Lord.’ ” <br>
                24 Now the Pharisees who had been sent <br>
                25 questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
                <br>
                26 “I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do not know. <br>
                27 He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” <br>
                28 This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <br>
                John Testifies About Jesus <br>
                29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the
                sin of
                the world! <br>
                30 This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before
                me.’ <br>
                31 I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed
                to
                Israel.” <br>
                32 Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.
                <br>
                33 And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on
                whom
                you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ <br>
                34 I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.” <br>
                John’s Disciples Follow Jesus <br>
                35 The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <br>
                36 When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” <br>
                37 When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <br>
                38 Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?”They said, “Rabbi” (which
                means
                “Teacher”), “where are you staying?” <br>
                39 “Come,” he replied, “and you will see.”So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that
                day
                with him. It was about four in the afternoon. <br>
                40 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed
                Jesus. <br>
                41 The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah”
                (that
                is, the Christ). <br>
                42 And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be
                called
                Cephas” (which, when translated, is Peter ).
                Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael <br>
                43 The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, “Follow me.” <br>
                44 Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <br>
                45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about
                whom
                the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” <br>
                46 “Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip. <br>
                47 When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, “Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no
                deceit.” <br>
                48 “How do you know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, “I saw you while you were still under the fig
                tree
                before Philip called you.” <br>
                49 Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.” <br>
                50 Jesus said, “You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things
                than that.” <br>
                51 He then added, “Very truly I tell you, you will see ‘heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and
                descending on’ the Son of Man.” <br>

            <h5>Jesus Changes Water Into Wine</h5> <br>
            <p>
                1 On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, <br>
                2 and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. <br>
                3 When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.” <br>
                4 “Woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.” <br>
                5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” <br>
                6 Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from
                <br>
                twenty to thirty gallons. <br>
                7 Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim. <br>
                8 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”They did so, <br>
                9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize
                where it
                <br>
                had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside
                <br>
                10 and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have
                had
                <br>
                too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.” <br>
                11 What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his
                glory;
                <br>
                and his disciples believed in him. <br>
                12 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they
                stayed
                <br>
                for a few days. <br>
                Jesus Clears the Temple Courts <br>
                13 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <br>
                14 In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables
                <br>
                exchanging money. <br>
                15 So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he
                scattered
                <br>
                the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. <br>
                16 To those who sold doves he said, “Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a
                market!”
                <br>
                17 His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will consume me.” <br>
                18 The Jews then responded to him, “What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?”
                <br>
                19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.” <br>
                20 They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in
                three
                <br>
                days?” <br>
                21 But the temple he had spoken of was his body. <br>
                22 After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the
                <br>
                scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken. <br>
                23 Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing
                and
                <br>
                believed in his name. <br>
                24 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. <br>
                25 He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person. <br>
            </p>
            <h4 id="3"> John 3</h4>

            <h5>Jesus Teaches Nicodemus</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                1 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. <br>
                2 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For
                no
                <br>
                one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.” <br>
                3 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again. ”
                <br>
                4 “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time
                into
                <br>
                their mother’s womb to be born!” <br>
                5 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of
                water
                <br>
                and the Spirit. <br>
                6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <br>
                7 You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’ <br>
                8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or
                where
                <br>
                it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.” <br>
                9 “How can this be?” Nicodemus asked. <br>
                10 “You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and do you not understand these things? <br>
                11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you
                <br>
                people do not accept our testimony. <br>
                12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak
                of
                <br>
                heavenly things? <br>
                13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man. <br>
                14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <br>
                15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.” <br>
                16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not
                <br>
                perish but have eternal life. <br>
                17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
                <br>
                18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already
                because
                <br>
                they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. <br>
                19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light
                because
                <br>
                their deeds were evil. <br>
                20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds
                will
                <br>
                be exposed. <br>
                21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they
                have
                <br>
                done has been done in the sight of God. <br>
                John Testifies Again About Jesus <br>
                22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time
                with
                <br>
                them, and baptized. <br>
                23 Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were
                <br>
                coming and being baptized. <br>
                24 (This was before John was put in prison.) <br>
                25 An argument developed between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of
                ceremonial
                <br>
                washing. <br>
                26 They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the
                Jordan—the
                <br>
                one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.” <br>
                27 To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. <br>
                28 You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.’ <br>
                29 The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him,
                and
                <br>
                is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <br>
                30 He must become greater; I must become less.” <br>
                31 The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and
                speaks
                <br>
                as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <br>
                32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <br>
                33 Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <br>
                34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <br>
                35 The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <br>
                36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for
                God’s
                <br>
                wrath remains on them. <br>

            <h5>Jesus Talks With a Samaritan Woman</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                1 Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than
                John—
                <br>
                2 although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. <br>
                3 So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. <br>
                4 Now he had to go through Samaria. <br>
                5 So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son
                Joseph.
                <br>
                6 Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was
                about
                <br>
                noon. <br>
                7 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give me a drink?” <br>
                8 (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) <br>
                9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a
                <br>
                drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ) <br>
                10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would
                have
                <br>
                asked him and he would have given you living water.” <br>
                11 “Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this
                living
                <br>
                water? <br>
                12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also
                his
                <br>
                sons and his livestock?” <br>
                13 Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, <br>
                14 but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become
                in
                <br>
                them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” <br>
                15 The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming
                here
                <br>
                to draw water.” <br>
                16 He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” <br>
                17 “I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are right when you say you have no husband.
                <br>
                18 The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have
                just
                <br>
                said is quite true.” <br>
                19 “Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet. <br>
                20 Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is
                in
                <br>
                Jerusalem.” <br>
                21 “Woman,” Jesus replied, “believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on
                this
                <br>
                mountain nor in Jerusalem. <br>
                22 You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the
                Jews.
                <br>
                23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit
                and
                <br>
                in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. <br>
                24 God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.” <br>
                25 The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain <br>
                everything to us.” <br>
                26 Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he.” <br>
                The Disciples Rejoin Jesus <br>
                27 Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one
                asked,
                <br>
                “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” <br>
                28 Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, <br>
                29 “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” <br>
                30 They came out of the town and made their way toward him. <br>
                31 Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.” <br>
                32 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” <br>
                33 Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?” <br>
                34 “My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. <br>
                35 Don’t you have a saying, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look
                at
                <br>
                the fields! They are ripe for harvest. <br>
                36 Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and
                the
                <br>
                reaper may be glad together. <br>
                37 Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true. <br>
                38 I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped
                the
                <br> <br>
                benefits of their labor.” <br>
                Many Samaritans Believe <br>
                39 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me
                <br>
                everything I ever did.” <br>
                40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. <br>
                41 And because of his words many more became believers. <br>
                42 They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for
                <br>
                ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.” <br>
                Jesus Heals an Official’s Son <br>
                43 After the two days he left for Galilee. <br>
                44 (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) <br>
                45 When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in
                Jerusalem
                <br>
                at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there. <br>
                46 Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a
                certain
                <br>
                royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. <br>
                47 When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to
                come
                <br>
                and heal his son, who was close to death. <br>
                48 “Unless you people see signs and wonders,” Jesus told him, “you will never believe.” <br>
                49 The royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” <br>
                50 “Go,” Jesus replied, “your son will live.”The man took Jesus at his word and departed. <br>
                51 While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. <br>
                52 When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, “Yesterday, at one in the
                <br>
                afternoon, the fever left him.” <br>
                53 Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, “Your son will
                <br>
                live.” So he and his whole household believed. <br>
                54 This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee. <br>

            <h5>The Healing at the Pool</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                1 Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. <br>
                2 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is
                <br>
                surrounded by five covered colonnades. <br>
                3 Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. <br>
                5 One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. <br>
                6 When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he
                asked <br>
                him, “Do you want to get well?” <br>
                7 “Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I
                am <br>
                trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.” <br>
                8 Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” <br>
                9 At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a
                <br>
                Sabbath, <br>
                10 and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids
                you to <br>
                carry your mat.” <br>
                11 But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ” <br>
                12 So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?” <br>
                13 The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was
                there. <br>
                14 Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or
                something <br>
                worse may happen to you.” <br>
                15 The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well. <br>
                The Authority of the Son <br>
                16 So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.
                <br>
                17 In his defense Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am
                <br>
                working.” <br>
                18 For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was
                <br>
                even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <br>
                19 Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do
                only <br>
                what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. <br>
                20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works
                than <br>
                these, so that you will be amazed. <br>
                21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is
                <br>
                pleased to give it. <br>
                22 Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, <br>
                23 that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not
                honor <br>
                the Father, who sent him. <br>
                24 “Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will
                not <br>
                be judged but has crossed over from death to life. <br>
                25 Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son
                of <br>
                God and those who hear will live. <br>
                26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. <br>
                27 And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. <br>
                28 “Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
                <br>
                29 and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil
                <br>
                will rise to be condemned. <br>
                30 By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please
                <br>
                myself but him who sent me. <br>
                Testimonies About Jesus <br>
                31 “If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. <br>
                32 There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true. <br>
                33 “You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. <br>
                34 Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. <br>
                35 John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. <br>
                36 “I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to
                finish—the <br>
                very works that I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me. <br>
                37 And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor
                seen <br>
                his form, <br>
                38 nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. <br>
                39 You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are
                the <br>
                very Scriptures that testify about me, <br>
                40 yet you refuse to come to me to have life. <br>
                41 “I do not accept glory from human beings, <br>
                42 but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. <br>
                43 I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name,
                you <br>
                will accept him. <br>
                44 How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from

            <h5>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                1 Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of
                Tiberias), <br>
                2 and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing
                the sick. <br>
                3 Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. <br>
                4 The Jewish Passover Festival was near. <br>
                5 When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where shall we
                buy bread <br>
                for these people to eat?” <br>
                6 He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. <br>
                7 Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages to buy enough bread for each one
                to have <br>
                a bite!” <br>
                8 Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, <br>
                9 “Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so
                many?” <br>
                10 Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat
                down (about <br>
                five thousand men were there). <br>
                11 Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they
                wanted. <br>
                He did the same with the fish. <br>
                12 When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left
                over. Let <br>
                nothing be wasted.” <br>
                13 So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left
                over by <br>
                those who had eaten. <br>
                14 After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, “Surely this is the Prophet who
                is to <br>
                come into the world.” <br>
                15 Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a
                mountain by <br>
                himself. <br>
                Jesus Walks on the Water <br>
                16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <br>
                17 where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and
                Jesus had <br>
                not yet joined them. <br>
                18 A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. <br>
                19 When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on
                the water; <br>
                and they were frightened. <br>
                20 But he said to them, “It is I; don’t be afraid.” <br>
                21 Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore
                where they <br>
                were heading. <br>
                22 The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one
                boat had <br>
                been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.
                <br>
                23 Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after
                the Lord <br>
                had given thanks. <br>
                24 Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats
                and went <br>
                to Capernaum in search of Jesus. <br>
                Jesus the Bread of Life <br>
                25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get
                here?” <br>
                26 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I
                performed <br>
                but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. <br>
                27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man
                will <br>
                give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” <br>
                28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” <br>
                29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” <br>
                30 So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will
                you do? <br>
                31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven
                to eat.’ <br>
                ” <br>
                32 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from
                heaven, but <br>
                it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. <br>
                33 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” <br>
                34 “Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” <br>
                35 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and
                whoever <br>
                believes in me will never be thirsty. <br>
                36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. <br>
                37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
                <br>
                38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. <br>
                39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but
                raise <br>
                them up at the last day. <br>
                40 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal
                life, <br>
                and I will raise them up at the last day.” <br>
                41 At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down
                from <br>
                heaven.” <br>
                42 They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now
                say, ‘I <br>
                came down from heaven’?” <br>
                43 “Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus answered. <br>
                44 “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the
                last <br>
                day. <br>
                45 It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the
                Father and <br>
                learned from him comes to me. <br>
                46 No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. <br>
                47 Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. <br>
                48 I am the bread of life. <br>
                49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. <br>
                50 But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. <br>
                51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This
                bread <br>
                is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” <br>
                52 Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to
                eat?” <br>
                53 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink
                his <br>
                blood, you have no life in you. <br>
                54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last
                day. <br>
                55 For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <br>
                56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. <br>
                57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me
                will live <br>
                because of me. <br>
                58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever
                feeds on <br>
                this bread will live forever.” <br>
                59 He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <br>
                Many Disciples Desert Jesus <br>
                60 On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?” <br>
                61 Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, “Does this offend you?
                <br>
                62 Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <br>
                63 The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full
                of the <br>
                Spirit and life. <br>
                64 Yet there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus had known from the beginning which of
                them did <br>
                not believe and who would betray him. <br>
                65 He went on to say, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has
                enabled <br>
                them.” <br>
                66 From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <br>
                67 “You do not want to leave too, do you?” Jesus asked the Twelve. <br>
                68 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <br>
                69 We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.” <br>
                70 Then Jesus replied, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!” <br>
                71 (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray
                him.) <br>

            <h5>Jesus Goes to the Festival of Tabernacles </h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                1 After this, Jesus went around in Galilee. He did not want to go about in Judea because the
                Jewish leaders <br>
                there were looking for a way to kill him. <br>
                2 But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, <br>
                3 Jesus’ brothers said to him, “Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may
                see the <br>
                works you do. <br>
                4 No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things,
                show yourself <br>
                to the world.” <br>
                5 For even his own brothers did not believe in him. <br>
                6 Therefore Jesus told them, “My time is not yet here; for you any time will do. <br>
                7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil. <br>
                8 You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully
                come.” <br>
                9 After he had said this, he stayed in Galilee. <br>
                10 However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in
                secret. <br>
                11 Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking, “Where is he?”
                <br>
                12 Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, “He is a good man.”
                Others <br>
                replied, “No, he deceives the people.” <br>
                13 But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders. <br>
                Jesus Teaches at the Festival <br>
                14 Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to
                teach. <br>
                15 The Jews there were amazed and asked, “How did this man get such learning without having been
                taught?” <br>
                16 Jesus answered, “My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. <br>
                17 Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or
                whether I <br>
                speak on my own. <br>
                18 Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the
                one who <br>
                sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. <br>
                19 Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill
                me?” <br>
                20 “You are demon-possessed,” the crowd answered. “Who is trying to kill you?” <br>
                21 Jesus said to them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. <br>
                22 Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but
                from the <br>
                patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath. <br>
                23 Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken,
                why are you <br>
                angry with me for healing a man’s whole body on the Sabbath? <br>
                24 Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly.” <br>
                Division Over Who Jesus Is <br>
                25 At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, “Isn’t this the man they are
                trying to kill? <br>
                26 Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities
                really <br>
                concluded that he is the Messiah? <br>
                27 But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is
                from.” <br>
                28 Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “Yes, you know me, and you know
                where I am <br>
                from. I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, <br>
                29 but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.” <br>
                30 At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet
                come. <br>
                31 Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, “When the Messiah comes, will he perform
                more signs <br>
                than this man?” <br>
                32 The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and
                the Pharisees <br>
                sent temple guards to arrest him. <br>
                33 Jesus said, “I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me.
                <br>
                34 You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.” <br>
                35 The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will
                he go where <br>
                our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <br>
                36 What did he mean when he said, ‘You will look for me, but you will not find me,’ and ‘Where I
                am, you <br>
                cannot come’?” <br>
                37 On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “Let
                anyone who is <br>
                thirsty come to me and drink. <br>
                38 Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within
                them.” <br>
                39 By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that
                time the <br>
                Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified. <br>
                40 On hearing his words, some of the people said, “Surely this man is the Prophet.” <br>
                41 Others said, “He is the Messiah.” Still others asked, “How can the Messiah come from Galilee?
                <br>
                42 Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David’s descendants and from
                Bethlehem, the town <br>
                where David lived?” <br>
                43 Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. <br>
                44 Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him. <br>
                Unbelief of the Jewish Leaders <br>
                45 Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them,
                “Why didn’t <br>
                you bring him in?” <br>
                46 “No one ever spoke the way this man does,” the guards replied. <br>
                47 “You mean he has deceived you also?” the Pharisees retorted. <br>
                48 “Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? <br>
                49 No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them.” <br>
                50 Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, <br>
                51 “Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?”
                <br>
                52 They replied, “Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does
                not come <br>
                out of Galilee.” <br>
                53 Then they all went home, <br>

            <h5>[The earliest manuscripts and many other ancient witnesses do not have John 7:53—8:11. A few
                manuscripts <br>
                include these verses, wholly or in part, after John 7:36, John 21:25, Luke 21:38 or Luke

            <br>
            <p>
                1 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <br>
                2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him,
                and he sat down <br>
                to teach them. <br>
                3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made
                her stand <br>
                before the group <br>
                4 and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. <br>
                5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” <br>
                6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But
                Jesus bent down <br>
                and started to write on the ground with his finger. <br>
                7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of
                you who is without <br>
                sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” <br>
                8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. <br>
                9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only
                Jesus was left, <br>
                with the woman still standing there. <br>
                10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”
                <br>
                11 “No one, sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and
                leave your life of <br>
                sin.” <br>
                Dispute Over Jesus’ Testimony <br>
                12 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever
                follows me will <br>
                never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” <br>
                13 The Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your
                testimony is not valid.” <br>
                14 Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know
                where I came from <br>
                and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. <br>
                15 You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. <br>
                16 But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the
                Father, who sent me. <br>
                17 In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true. <br>
                18 I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.” <br>
                19 Then they asked him, “Where is your father?” “You do not know me or my Father,” Jesus
                replied. “If you <br>
                knew me, you would know my Father also.” <br>
                20 He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the
                offerings were put. Yet <br>
                no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come. <br>
                Dispute Over Who Jesus Is <br>
                21 Once more Jesus said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will
                die in your sin. <br>
                Where I go, you cannot come.” <br>
                22 This made the Jews ask, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, ‘Where I go, you
                cannot come’?” <br>
                23 But he continued, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not
                of this world. <br>
                24 I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will
                indeed die in <br>
                your sins.” <br>
                25 “Who are you?” they asked. “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus
                replied. <br>
                26 “I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I
                have heard from him <br>
                I tell the world.” <br>
                27 They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. <br>
                28 So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he
                and that I do <br>
                nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. <br>
                29 The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases
                him.” <br>
                30 Even as he spoke, many believed in him. <br>
                Dispute Over Whose Children Jesus’ Opponents Are <br>
                31 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really
                my disciples. <br>
                32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” <br>
                33 They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone.
                How can you say <br>
                that we shall be set free?” <br>
                34 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. <br>
                35 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. <br>
                36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. <br>
                37 I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me,
                because you have no <br>
                room for my word. <br>
                38 I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing what you
                have heard from <br>
                your father. ” <br>
                39 “Abraham is our father,” they answered. “If you were Abraham’s children,” said Jesus,
                “then you would do <br>
                what Abraham did. <br>
                40 As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I
                heard from God. <br>
                Abraham did not do such things. <br>
                41 You are doing the works of your own father.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they
                protested. “The <br>
                only Father we have is God himself.” <br>
                42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here
                from God. I have <br>
                not come on my own; God sent me. <br>
                43 Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. <br>
                44 You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He
                was a murderer <br>
                from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he
                speaks his <br>
                native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. <br>
                45 Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! <br>
                46 Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe
                me? <br>
                47 Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not
                belong to God.” <br>
                Jesus’ Claims About Himself <br>
                48 The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and
                demon-possessed?” <br>
                49 “I am not possessed by a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.
                <br>
                50 I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.
                <br>
                51 Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.” <br>
                52 At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so
                did the prophets, <br>
                yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. <br>
                53 Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you
                think you are?” <br>
                54 Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as
                your God, is <br>
                the one who glorifies me. <br>
                55 Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you,
                but I do know <br>
                him and obey his word. <br>
                56 Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”
                <br>
                57 “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!” <br>
                58 “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!” <br>
                59 At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from
                the temple <br>
                grounds. <br>

            <h5>Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                1 As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. <br>
                2 His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born
                blind?” <br>
                3 “Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, “but this happened so that the
                works of God might <br>
                be displayed in him. <br>
                4 As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when
                no one can work. <br>
                5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” <br>
                6 After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on
                the man’s eyes. <br>
                7 “Go,” he told him, “wash in the Pool of Siloam” (this word means “Sent”). So the man
                went and washed, and <br>
                came home seeing. <br>
                8 His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same
                man who used to sit <br>
                and beg?” <br>
                9 Some claimed that he was. Others said, “No, he only looks like him.” But he himself
                insisted, “I am the <br>
                man.” <br>
                10 “How then were your eyes opened?” they asked. <br>
                11 He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me
                to go to Siloam and <br>
                wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.” <br>
                12 “Where is this man?” they asked him. “I don’t know,” he said. <br>
                The Pharisees Investigate the Healing <br>
                13 They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. <br>
                14 Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath.
                <br>
                15 Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. “He put mud on
                my eyes,” the man <br>
                replied, “and I washed, and now I see.” <br>
                16 Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the
                Sabbath.” But others <br>
                asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So they were divided. <br>
                17 Then they turned again to the blind man, “What have you to say about him? It was your
                eyes he opened.” <br>
                The man replied, “He is a prophet.” <br>
                18 They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until
                they sent for the <br>
                man’s parents. <br>
                19 “Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it
                that now he can see?” <br>
                20 “We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born blind. <br>
                21 But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age;
                he will speak for <br>
                himself.” <br>
                22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had
                decided that anyone <br>
                who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. <br>
                23 That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.” <br>
                24 A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God by telling
                the truth,” they <br>
                said. “We know this man is a sinner.” <br>
                25 He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was
                blind but now I <br>
                see!” <br>
                26 Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” <br>
                27 He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear
                it again? Do you <br>
                want to become his disciples too?” <br>
                28 Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are
                disciples of Moses! <br>
                29 We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he
                comes from.” <br>
                30 The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he
                opened my eyes. <br>
                31 We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does
                his will. <br>
                32 Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. <br>
                33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” <br>
                34 To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!”
                And they threw him <br>
                out. <br>
                Spiritual Blindness <br>
                35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do you
                believe in the Son of <br>
                Man?” <br>
                36 “Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.” <br>
                37 Jesus said, “You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.” <br>
                38 Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. <br>
                39 Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and
                those who see will <br>
                become blind.” <br>
                40 Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind
                too?” <br>
                41 Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you
                claim you can see, your <br>
                guilt remains. <br>

            <h5>The Good Shepherd and His Sheep</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                1 “Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the
                gate, but climbs in by <br>
                some other way, is a thief and a robber. <br>
                2 The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. <br>
                3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls
                his own sheep by name <br>
                and leads them out. <br>
                4 When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep
                follow him because they know <br>
                his voice. <br>
                5 But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him
                because they do not recognize <br>
                a stranger’s voice.” <br>
                6 Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was
                telling them. <br>
                7 Therefore Jesus said again, “Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.
                <br>
                8 All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not
                listened to them. <br>
                9 I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go
                out, and find pasture. <br>
                10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may
                have life, and have it to <br>
                the full. <br>
                11 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. <br>
                12 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees
                the wolf coming, he <br>
                abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
                <br>
                13 The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
                <br>
                14 “I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— <br>
                15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the
                sheep. <br>
                16 I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They
                too will listen to my <br>
                voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. <br>
                17 The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up
                again. <br>
                18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to
                lay it down and <br>
                authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.” <br>
                19 The Jews who heard these words were again divided. <br>
                20 Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?”
                <br>
                21 But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a
                demon open the eyes of <br>
                the blind?” <br>
                Further Conflict Over Jesus’ Claims <br>
                22 Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, <br>
                23 and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. <br>
                24 The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us
                in suspense? If you are <br>
                the Messiah, tell us plainly.” <br>
                25 Jesus answered, “I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my
                Father’s name testify about <br>
                me, <br>
                26 but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. <br>
                27 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. <br>
                28 I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them
                out of my hand. <br>
                29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all ; no one can snatch them
                out of my Father’s <br>
                hand. <br>
                30 I and the Father are one.” <br>
                31 Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him, <br>
                32 but Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For
                which of these do you <br>
                stone me?” <br>
                33 “We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy,
                because you, a mere man, <br>
                claim to be God.” <br>
                34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods”
                ’ ? <br>
                35 If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be
                set aside— <br>
                36 what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the
                world? Why then do you <br>
                accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’? <br>
                37 Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father. <br>
                38 But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you
                may know and understand <br>
                that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.” <br>
                39 Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp. <br>
                40 Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing
                in the early days. <br>
                There he stayed, <br>
                41 and many people came to him. They said, “Though John never performed a sign, all
                that John said about <br>
                this man was true.” <br>
                42 And in that place many believed in Jesus. <br>
